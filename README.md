# Netflix_EDA_PROJECT

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Netflix dataset. The goal was to uncover insights about the content available on Netflix, such as trends in movie and TV show releases, genre distributions, and other patterns. The analysis was performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key steps in the project include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent values.
- Visualizing trends in content release over the years.
- Analyzing the distribution of genres and content types (movies vs. TV shows).
- Exploring relationships between variables such as release year, ratings, and duration.

The findings from this analysis provide a deeper understanding of Netflix's content library and can help in making data-driven decisions.
